- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies required to run the application, ensuring compatibility and ease of setup.
- `constants.py`: Contains constants such as API keys and other configuration variables used throughout the application.
- `logo.jpeg`: Used as the application's logo displayed in the Streamlit sidebar, enhancing brand identity.
- `.gitignore`: Helps in maintaining a clean repository by ignoring files that should not be tracked by Git.
